# Notes

## Equations and Model
Covers: Derivation of $K_{m2}$ for Question 1, the use of the Lineweaver-Burke plot (from which you can get Km1 and Vmax) for different S2. 

Stoichiometric matrix N, steady state equillibrium.

## Results and Figures

Lineweaver-Burke plot, table with Vmax and Km1 we read from that.

Km2 calculated by equation.

## Discussion

Lineweaver-Burke plot: since all lines are parrelel this is a ping pong mechanism.

It took 660.29 seconds (11.0 minutes) to reach a concentration below 1 g/L.
